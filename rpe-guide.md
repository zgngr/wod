### Progressive Loading Percentages

- We build quality of movement on 50-60%
- We build speed and explosiveness on 70-75%
- We build strength on 80-85%
- And after 90% we destroy everything

**Note:** That is why we don't go on 90%+ so often and we check/show here our performance ONLY when we are ready for this!
