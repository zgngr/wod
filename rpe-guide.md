### Progressive Loading Percentages

- We build quality of movement on 50-60%
- We build speed and explosiveness on 70-75%
- We build strength on 80-85%
- And after 90% we destroy everything

**Note:** That is why we don't go on 90%+ so often and we check/show here our performance ONLY when we are ready for this!

## RPE Guidelines for Olympic Weightlifting Complexes

In Olympic weightlifting, **complexes** (multiple lifts in one sequence) are usually performed at **lower RPEs** than singles because fatigue accumulates and the goal is often technique, speed, or positional strength.

### **Typical RPE Ranges**

#### **1. Technical Complexes**

*Examples: `hang clean + clean`, `snatch pull + snatch`, `3-position snatch`*

* **RPE 6–7**
* Focus on technique, tempo, and consistency
* Moderate loads with crisp bar speed

#### **2. Strength-Building Complexes**

*Examples: `clean pull + clean`, `snatch deadlift + snatch pull`, `pull + hang + full`*

* **RPE 7–8**
* Challenging but still maintains proper positions
* Often used during strength phases

#### **3. Power / Speed Complexes**

*Examples: `power clean + power jerk`, `tall snatch + snatch`*

* **RPE 6–7**
* Emphasis on speed and timing

#### **4. Heavy / Competition-Specific Complexes**

*Examples: `clean + jerk + jerk`, `clean + hang clean`*

* **RPE 7.5–8.5**
* Submaximal but demanding
* Used sparingly to avoid technical breakdown

---

### **Why Complexes Rarely Go Above RPE 8–8.5**

* Technique deteriorates quickly with fatigue
* Goal is typically *quality over load*
* High-RPE complexes can reinforce poor habits (e.g., early arm bend, slow pull)

### **Summary Table**

| Complex Type                 | Common RPE  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Technical                    | **6–7**     |
| Speed/Power                  | **6–7**     |
| Strength / Positional        | **7–8**     |
| Heavy / Competition-Specific | **7.5–8.5** |
